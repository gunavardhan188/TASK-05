This packet sniffer is a simple Python-based program built using the Scapy library for educational purposes. Its primary function is to capture and display basic information about network packets as they traverse a selected network interface.

Key Features

âšªPacket Capture: Monitors live network traffic, capturing packets in real time as they pass through the network adapter.

âšªSource & Destination IP: For each captured packet containing an IP layer, the tool displays the originating and receiving IP addresses, helping users understand communication endpoints.

âšªProtocol Identification: Reveals the transport protocol number detected in packets (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), giving insight into network traffic types.

âšªPayload Preview: Shows the first portion (e.g., up to 50 bytes) of the packetâ€™s payload, allowing users to see the raw data being transmitted.

âšªSimple Output: Information is printed to the console for clarity and ease of useâ€”no complex parsing, visualization, or storage; ideal for learning and quick inspection.

ðŸ”´Usage Context
This basic packet sniffer is best suited for classroom demonstrations, homework assignments, and training labs that introduce students to fundamental network concepts. By focusing on minimal, essential packet details, it encourages beginners to explore network structures and behaviors without overwhelming complexity.

ðŸ”´Ethical Guidance
The packet sniffer is intended exclusively for educational work on authorized networks or test environments. Do not run or distribute the tool for unauthorized monitoring of network traffic, as this is both unethical and illegal. Always operate with explicit permission and respect privacy and data protection rules.
